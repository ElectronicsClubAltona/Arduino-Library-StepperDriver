/*

  This code is the Hello World on the VEXTA UD2115 on the Arduino.
  It uses the Two-Pulse Wire approach to move the motor - i.e. pulsing
  one wire moves it one direction, pulsing a second wire moves it the
  other direction.

  Each pair of wires on the VEXTA is actually leads through a photocoupler

  - The (+) wire is the source for lighting it and therefore
  is ALWAYS held HIGH (could probably be just Vcc)
  - The (-) wire is the sink, and is sent LOW to create the pulse
  the VEXTA stepper driver is looking for as a signal to step.
  Otherwise this line should be kept HIGH

  The Circuit:
   PIN 4: Attached to attached to the Pulse Input Terminal (+)
  This pin is ALWAYS held HIGH, should be able to just tie it
  to the Vcc Bus, check this
   PIN 5: To Pulse Input Terminal (-)
   PIN 6: Attached to attached to the direction (CW/CCW) Input
  Terminal (+) This pin is ALWAYS held HIGH, should be able to
  just tie it to the Vcc Bus, check this
   PIN 7: Attached to the direction (CW/CCW) Input Terminal (-)
   GND - must be attached to the FG connection at the end of the
  VEXTA's terminal block.

  The Behavior:
  The motor moves 50 steps to the left
  The motor moves 100 steps to the right
  The motor moves 200 steps to the left
  The motor moves 400 steps to the right
